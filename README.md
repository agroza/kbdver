Keyboard Controller Version

## Synopsis

This program queries the keyboard controller in a PC AT-class computer and retrieves the version number.\
I wrote this program to support my research essay on the [80386DX ROM BIOS keyboard controller compatibility](http://www.alexandrugroza.ro/microelectronics/essays-research/80386dx-rom-bios/index.html).

### Program Usage

This is a simple program without any commandline parameters. Just execute the program in a real MS-DOS environment.
